SQL Alchemy allows programmers to execute queries through Python using Python class models instead of actual SQL.

A model is a way of representing a SQL table entry within Python. Using the model, you can create new SQL entries
and turn them into JSON formats.

A view is a way of receiving client-side requests and turn the input data into a form that the model can use for queries.
